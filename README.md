Project Summary 
Our project is based on how cross-agency collaboration impacts gun violence in New Mexico. Specifically focusing on programs or organizations that work closely with communities to help reduce gun violence in their communities. The project also touches upon how the government works with these groups to create legislation and other measures to help combat gun violence. Data was collected from a variety of sources and includes information such as arrests involving gun violence, firearms seized, and deaths due to firearms.
